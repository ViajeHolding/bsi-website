## Front-end

- Ming: Jadi di bagian group company gak perlu short desc, jadi langsung logo + keterangan tiap logo. sedangkan partnership / mitra itu minta ada short desc ya pak
- Cek feedback file for 29-11-2022 in `docs` folder.

- Remove `collapse` and `show` state from all navbar elements.
- Create a better box shadow for navbar.
- Exchange page:
  - Accordion header and body border radius to transition from 10px to 0px when active.
  - URLs for exchange pages.
- Navbar:
  - Use primary color as background. Adjust other colors such as text accordingly.
  - Change English language flag from UK to US.
  - Active state.
  - Once first release is finished, create a fixed positioned navbar.
- Footer:
  - Ask for play store URLs.
- About us page:
  - Add Above The Fold (ATF) background image.
  - ATF background image to be transparent at the bottom. Use Photoshop if possible.
  - Set `max-width` for ATF body and image. Also center-align it.
- Button hover and active state.
- Smaller language flag right margin.

## Back-end

- Language data middleware to be included in its own object. Don't spread the object directly.
- Change `/bsi` to `/home`. Basically change it to become the home page. Slowly migrate from old home page layout to the new one, don't delete the files related to it right away.
